A light (two colors) will appear at random times. A player has to click the button when the light appears. 
A player has to click the button when the light appears. The right button and left button will each be for different colors. If the button is clicked at right timing, it will make a high pitched tone and one point will be added (visible from serial monitor). If the button is clicked at the wrong timing (Clicked wrong button for wrong color), it will make a low pitched tone and one point will be deducted. If the button is not pressed during the light appearance, the point will not be added or deducted and no sound will be played. After the round ends, the final score will be visible to the user by the amount of led lights that are on (Max 10). The switch will reset and a new round begins.
